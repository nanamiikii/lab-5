For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!

## Instructions

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins, driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)

Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the tables manually.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

### Tips 

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go along.


## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in all of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!

**Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**
Hint: Make sure you check for interviews with any suspects!

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-crime-scene-report

#sorting the crime scene report for just data from 01.15.2018 in SQL City, keeping the date a double for now...
#also selecting the description to get a better hint
crime_scene_report |>
      filter(city == "SQL City", type == "murder", date == 20180115) |>
      select(description)
```
#### selecting the witnesses from 'person' 

```{r}
#| label: selecting-the-witnesses

witnesses <- person |> #first witness criteria | second witness criteria
             filter((address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr" & address_number == max(address_number)) |
                    (str_detect(name, "Annabel") & address_street_name == "Franklin Ave"))

witnesses
```

#### looking at their interviews
```{r}
#|label: checking-witnesses
#using personid/id, join their interview information onto witness using a right join 

witnesses |>
      left_join(interview, by = c("id" = "person_id")) |>
      pull(name, transcript)

```

What we know about the murderer currently:

~~~~
- (supposedly) they went to Annabel's gym on January 9 
- Get Fit Now Gym membership number started with 48Z, gold member of gym
- Car license plate contains 'H42W'
~~~~

#### Does Annabel go to Get Fit Now?
```{r}
#| label: Annabel-gym-check

#selecting the 2nd row (Annabel's row) and checking if her name is in the member list of get fit now.
str_detect(witnesses[2,]$name, str_subset(get_fit_now_member$name, "Annabel"))
```
#### Did Annabel go on January 9? 
```{r}
#| label: Annabel-Gym-Time

#https://chatgpt.com/share/671e94f0-a1a0-8013-9445-77d9eafda394

annabel_gym_checkin <- get_fit_now_member |>
                       filter(name == witnesses[2,]$name) |>
                       inner_join(get_fit_now_check_in, by = c("id" = "membership_id"))

annabel_gym_checkin
```

since Annabel is a member of Get Fit Now, and did in fact check in on January 9, we also have the time she was there. This is useful information as we can narrow down who satisfies the following: 

~~~~
- Get Fit Now Membership id: starts with '48Z'
- Get Fit Now Membership status: Gold
- Was at Get Fit Now between 16:00 - 17:00
- Was at Get Fit Now on January 9, 2018
- Car License plate contains 'H42W'
~~~~

#### Using the information we know about Get Fit Now, narrow it down. 
```{r}
#|label: Get-Fit-Now-suspects
#https://chatgpt.com/share/671f0318-e2d4-8013-adf9-b22360032e44

#filtering the data
suspects <- get_fit_now_member |>
            filter(str_starts(id, "48Z"), membership_status == "gold") |> 
            left_join(get_fit_now_check_in, by = c("id" = "membership_id")) |>
            left_join(person, by = c("person_id" = "id")) |>
            left_join(drivers_license, join_by("license_id" == "id")) |>
            filter(str_detect(plate_number, "H42W"), if_all(everything(), ~ !is.na(.)))

suspects

```

Prime suspect = Jeremy Bowers, but should check what he has to say...

#### Suspect Interviews...
```{r}
#| label: interview-suspects

interview |>
      filter(person_id == suspects$person_id) |>
      pull(transcript)
    
```
So from Jeremy, we got: 

~~~~
- income = high 
- gender = female
- hair color = red
- height = 65-67, 
- hair color = red, 
- car make = Tesla
- car model = Model S
- Went to SQL Symphony concert 3 times in 12/2017 (201712--)
~~~~

#### Let's find that woman...
```{r}
#|label: finding-the-hirer

findingFemales <- drivers_license |>
                  filter(
                         65 <= height & height <= 67, 
                         hair_color == "red", 
                         gender == "female", 
                         car_make == "Tesla", 
                         car_model == "Model S") |>
                  left_join(person, by = c("id" = "license_id")) |>
                  left_join(income, by = "ssn") |>
                  select(person_id = id.y, name, annual_income)

facebook_event_checkin |>
      filter(event_name == "SQL Symphony Concert", str_starts(date, "201712")) |>
      group_by(person_id) |>
      summarize(checkIns = n()) |>
      right_join(findingFemales, by = "person_id") |>
      filter(checkIns == 3, if_all(everything(), ~ !is.na(.)))
```

So the full story: Miranda Priestly hired Jeremy Bowers to kill the person.The brain behind the murder is Miranda and the actual person who committed the murder is Jeremy. 

## And the final suspect is...

*Miranda Priestly? She was behind it all but Jeremy Bowers was the hitman so... Both to jail they go!*
